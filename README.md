Iris Flower Classification
Project Overview:

Iris Flower Classification is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts the species of an iris flower based on sepal and petal measurements. This project demonstrates the complete supervised learning workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation and visualization.

Objective:

To classify iris flowers into three species:

Iris Setosa

Iris Versicolor

Iris Virginica

using four numerical features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Problem Type:

Supervised Machine Learning – Classification

Dataset:

Iris Dataset (Scikit-learn)

Total Samples: 150

Features: 4

Target Classes: 3

Algorithms Used:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree Classifier

Logistic Regression

Project Workflow:

Load and explore the dataset

Perform data visualization

Split data into training and testing sets

Train multiple classification models

Evaluate models using accuracy

Visualize feature relationships and importance

Visualizations:

Pairplot to analyze feature separation between species

Feature importance plot using Decision Tree

Tools & Technologies:

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Results:

All three models achieved high accuracy, with petal length and petal width identified as the most important features for classification.
