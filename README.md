# iris-classification-project
Iris Flower Classification Built a machine learning classification model to predict iris flower species using sepal and petal measurements. Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression algorithms, compared their performance using accuracy, and visualized feature relationships and importance to understand model behavior.
